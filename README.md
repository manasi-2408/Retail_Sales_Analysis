# 📊 Retail Sales Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Retail Sales Analysis** using **SQL, Python (EDA), and Dashboard visualization**. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights by performing structured data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visual storytelling.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow commonly used in real-world data analyst roles.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains retail transaction-level data, including:

* Transaction date and time
* Customer demographics (gender, age)
* Product category
* Quantity sold
* Price per unit
* Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
* Total sales amount

Each row represents an individual sales transaction.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Python)

Performed using **Pandas & NumPy**:

* Removed duplicate records
* Handled missing values using **median imputation**
* Converted date and time columns into proper datetime formats
* Extracted **year, month, and sale hour** for time-based analysis
* Corrected column inconsistencies
* Created a **Profit/Loss** column based on sales and cost logic

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analyses and visualizations include:

* Revenue contribution of **top 5 customers**
* Category preference of high-value customers
* Category analysis by gender
* Monthly sales comparison for **2022 vs 2023**
* Profit vs Loss distribution (overall and year-wise)
* Average spending behavior by age
* Sales distribution by hour of the day
* Correlation heatmap of numerical variables
* Category-wise sales distribution using boxplots

Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**.

## 🛢️ SQL Analysis

SQL was used to:

* Create and manage the retail sales database
* Perform aggregations and filtering
* Analyze customer behavior and sales trends
* Validate insights generated through Python analysis

---

## 📊 Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created to:

* Summarize key KPIs
* Visualize trends and comparisons
* Support data-driven decision making

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **SQL**
* **Dashboard Tool** (Power BI / equivalent)
* **GitHub**
